## Project Description
We expect users to feel unrestricted to options when coloring on Ipad Pro. The interface puts tools in the center since users are more likely to change tools for corrective or transformative purposes. The color palette sits on the side because our usability tests showed users tend to stick to a singular color for long periods. But at the same time, users wanted to be ever-aware of those color options. This makes access to the color palette a lesser priority unlike the higher priority of creative processes such as erasure and shape-forming.
